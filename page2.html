                <h2>The Combat System in D&D 5e</h2>
                <p>Combat in D&D 5e is a tactical experience that relies on a turn-based initiative system. Players and enemies roll for **initiative**, determining the order in which they act. Each character has a set number of **actions** they can take, such as **attacking**, **casting spells**, or **using an item**. Players can also choose to **move** around the battlefield, take **bonus actions**, or even attempt to **dodge** or **disengage** from enemies. Combat is fast-paced and can change dramatically depending on the strategy of the players.</p>
                <p>Additionally, certain classes have access to **special combat abilities**, such as **rage** for Barbarians or **divine smite** for Paladins. These abilities add depth to combat, giving players more tactical options and allowing for creative problem-solving in battles.</p>

                <h3>Spells and Magic in D&D 5e</h3>
                <p>Magic is a cornerstone of D&D 5e. Many characters, especially spellcasters like Wizards and Sorcerers, rely on a vast array of spells to influence the world around them. Spells can range from healing magic to powerful offensive effects. Each spell has unique components—such as **verbal** (spoken words), **somatic** (gestures), and **material** (specific items)—and the range and effects of spells can vary widely.</p>
                <p>Spellcasters have **spell slots** that limit the number of spells they can cast per day. As characters level up, they gain access to higher-level spells and more spell slots, unlocking powerful new abilities. Magic in 5e is flexible, and the rich variety of spells allows players to customize their characters in exciting ways.</p>
