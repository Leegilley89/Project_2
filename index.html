                <h1>Introduction to Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition</h1>
                <p>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) 5th Edition is the modern version of the classic role-playing game. Known for its accessible mechanics, it offers players the opportunity to create unique characters and immerse themselves in a world of adventure. Players take on the role of characters, guided by a Dungeon Master (DM), who narrates the world and presents challenges. The game's core principles are collaboration, strategy, and storytelling.</p>
                <p>Since its release in 2014, 5e has become the most popular version of D&D, offering a balanced combination of roleplay and tactical gameplay. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a new player, 5e provides a flexible system that can accommodate a wide range of playstyles. From intense combat scenarios to deep character development, there's something for everyone in D&D 5e.</p>

                <h2>Character Creation in D&D 5e</h2>
                <p>Creating a character in D&D 5e is an exciting process that lets you craft a unique persona within a shared fantasy world. Players choose a character's **race**, **class**, and **background**, all of which impact their abilities and role in the game. From Elves and Dwarves to Wizards and Fighters, the options are vast, and the choices shape the story of your adventure.</p>
                <p>Once the foundational aspects are chosen, players roll for their **ability scores** (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). These scores influence everything your character can do, from combat to skill checks and saving throws. The goal is to build a character that aligns with your chosen playstyle and adds to the collaborative story experience.</p>

                <h3>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
                <p>At the heart of D&D 5e lies the **d20 system**. When performing actions, players roll a d20 and add modifiers based on their character's abilities. The outcome determines success or failureâ€”whether it's attacking an enemy, making a skill check, or dodging a trap. This simple yet flexible mechanic makes gameplay easy to understand, while still allowing for deep strategic play.</p>
                <p>Players also engage in combat, explore the world, and interact with NPCs. Combat is turn-based, with each character taking actions like attacking, casting spells, or healing. The system also emphasizes tactical decisions like positioning, team synergy, and resource management, ensuring that each session is dynamic and engaging.</p>
